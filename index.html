        <p>
            An astronaut (from the Ancient Greek ἄστρον (astron), meaning 'star', and ναύτης (nautes), meaning 'sailor') is a person trained, equipped, and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.

        <p>In 1998, five years before his death, a prepared obituary written by the Associated Press was inadvertently released, resulting in his death being announced on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. However, he remained in relatively good health until late in his old age, though he became somewhat frail in his last few years. In June 2000 at age 97, he spent nearly a week in a California hospital being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding. In August 2001 at age 98, he spent close to two weeks in a hospital recovering from pneumonia.</p>

        <p>On the morning of July 27, 2003, they died of pneumonia at the age of 100 at his home in Toluca Lake, California two months after his 100th birthday. His grandson Zach told TV interviewer Soledad O'Brien that, when asked on his deathbed where they wanted to be buried, he told his friend, Dolores, "Surprise me."</p>
